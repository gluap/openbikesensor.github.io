> We stand on the shoulders of giants.

The development of the OpenBikeSensor would not have been possible without the
work of countless other people who, like us, chose to publish their work and
make it available for everyone.

While we cannot list everything we build upon, here are some honorable mentions
that we would like to acknowledge, either because they are obscure and little
known but deserve publicity, or have tremendous impact on our project.

In no particular order:

* The [ArduinoJson](https://arduinojson.org/v6/example/config/) library
* [Interface for OTA Web Updates](https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp32-ota-web-updater-arduino-ide/) by lastminuteengineers.com
